# becalmstation webapp
This is a graphical frontend that can run in the raspberry pi to demo of how a becalm-station can be self-contained and allow the visualization of data without the need for the Becalm-server and Frontend. This provides a more accurate real time monitoring of measures of a given becalm-station but does not enable mass monitoring of patients.
